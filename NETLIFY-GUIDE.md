# Netlify Deployment Guide for Mr Sindhu Furniture and Electronics

This guide will help you deploy your website to Netlify without dependency errors.

## Preparation Steps

1. Download your project from Replit as a zip file
2. Extract it to your local computer
3. Push it to your GitHub repository:
   ```
   git add .
   git commit -m "Prepare for Netlify deployment"
   git push -u origin main
   ```

## Netlify Deployment

### Direct Deployment (Easiest)

1. Go to [Netlify.com](https://www.netlify.com/) and sign up/log in
2. Click "Add new site" → "Import an existing project"
3. Select GitHub and connect your account
4. Choose your repository: mohitsindhu121/Web

### Basic Configuration

Configure the following build settings:
- Build command: `npm run build`
- Publish directory: `dist`
- Click "Deploy site"

### Environment Variables

After deployment, go to:
1. Site settings → Environment variables
2. Add the following variables:
   - `DATABASE_URL`: Your database connection string
   - `NODE_ENV`: production

### Configure Custom Domain

1. After deployment, go to "Domain settings"
2. Click "Add custom domain"
3. Enter your domain name
4. Follow the steps to verify ownership and set up DNS

## Important: Fixing the "Cannot find module" Error

If you get the "Cannot find module" error:

### Option 1: Simplified Deployment
1. Focus on deploying the frontend only:
   - Remove the `/netlify` folder entirely
   - Deploy again with the same build settings

### Option 2: Manual Package Installation
1. After deployment, go to "Functions" in the Netlify dashboard
2. Click on the function that's failing
3. Click "Settings" and manually add the missing dependencies

### Option 3: Use Netlify CLI
1. Install Netlify CLI: `npm install -g netlify-cli`
2. Log in: `netlify login`
3. Initialize your site: `netlify init`
4. Deploy: `netlify deploy --prod`

## Testing Your Deployment

After successful deployment, check:
1. Your website is accessible at the Netlify URL
2. All pages load correctly
3. Product images and details display properly
4. Review functionality works
5. Contact form submits properly

If you encounter any issues with backend functionality, consider using a dedicated backend hosting service like Render or Railway and connect it to your Netlify frontend.
